# Gesture-controlled-wheelchair
This project is a smart gesture-controlled wheelchair designed to assist individuals with mobility challenges. It uses an accelerometer sensor to detect hand movements, which are transmitted wirelessly through ESP32 modules to control the wheelchair’s direction. A flex sensor is incorporated separately to identify emergency situations—when activated, it sends instant notifications to a caregiver’s mobile phone via the Blynk cloud platform. The system also features obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors to ensure safe navigation. Combining gesture control, emergency alerts, and safety mechanisms, this wheelchair enhances user independence, safety, and communication, making it ideal for people with limited mobility.
The system works by placing an accelerometer on the user's hand to detect its orientation and motion. These signals are read by an ESP32 microcontroller and wirelessly transmitted to another ESP32 unit mounted on the wheelchair. Based on the received gesture data, the wheelchair moves forward, left, or right. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles and prevent collisions by stopping or redirecting the wheelchair. A flex sensor is also attached to the user’s hand or finger, which when bent in a specific way, triggers an emergency alert. This alert is sent to a mobile phone using the Blynk platform.
